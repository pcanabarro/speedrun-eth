# Speedrun Ethereum - Development Training

by pcanabarro

### Training & Learning repo based on [Speedrun Ethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/).

If you want help and understand more about Solidity i'd reccomend you this development testing!

Let's web3 it!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pcanabarro/speedrun-eth
```

### NOTES

Challange #0 - It is amazing, that's my first experience testing, minting and sending NFT across a local blockchain where I can see the logs and undestand what's happening behind. Next step is deploy this contract in a Testnet!
